# PickFoodForMe
PickFood4Me is a web application that helps users decide where to eat food through current location or city input.

# Motivation
My friends and I cannot ever decide where to eat food. Arguing about where to eat takes a lot of time and sometimes doesnt even result in a place being picked. This app was made so that everyone could agree on a specific spot to eat at.
